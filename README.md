# TO DO #

Add info to explain what your projects is and anything your user or fellow developers might need to know to use the project, like the format of your config file and where in the directory it should be stored

Handle browser back button and refresh pages accordingly.

Handle a manually entered URL in browser. Or, refresh browser with /search/topic URL.

Handle url /search without a topic. Should result be a default search or a page not found?

Research test script in slack.

Test:
- first search is link
- first search is form submit
- browser back button
- manually enter a url that's not /search/...


# Stuff Added #

The search term is included in the gallery header and No Results page.

A Loading message is displayed between submitting a search and displaying the results.

A No Results page is displayed when search returns nothing.

A "Page Not Found" page is displayed if URL path does not begin with /search

# Original README.md generated by Create React App #

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
